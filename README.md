# Learning to complete images using only noisy observations  

Most of the image reconstruction models uses fully-observed samples to train the network. However, obtaining high resolution samples can be very expensive or impractical for some applications. 

This network brings together two ideas:  
* ambientGAN  
* Globally and Locall Consistent Image Completion
